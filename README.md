# Python-Excel-Extractor
# Extracts Data from an Excel file using columns header, import it to another Excel file, and use a user-entry column name as a matching criteria.

# This is only a raw .py file, you have to actually create a new project and paste it. For images, paste the file into the images file, just paste it into your newly created project, and change the lines in the code to the new location:

# Change these lines: 
        image = Image.open(r"C:\Users\Castro\PycharmProjects\Data_Extractor\images\Background.jpeg")
        self.bg_image = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image)

        logo_image = Image.open(r"C:\Users\Castro\PycharmProjects\Data_Extractor\images\file.ico")
        self.logo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(logo_image)
